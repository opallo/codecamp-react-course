# codecamp-react-course
A repo for a CodeCamp React.js course

I have one index.js file to render the DOM from for convenience while practicing. Just import & swap out the app being rendered :)

Currently working on a notes app that uses pretty much everything Iâ€™ve learned about react so far, and then some.  
Need to learn some more about integrating form submissions and input changes with React state and data management.
Should have some kind of working prototype up sometime tomorrow!
